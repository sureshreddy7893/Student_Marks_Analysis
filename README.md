📊 Student Marks Analysis Project

📝 Overview
This project analyzes student performance based on *subject-wise marks* and *attendance data* using Python.  
The goal is to uncover insights about how attendance affects academic performance and identify subjects where students struggle most.

📂 Dataset Description
- *Columns*:  
  - StudentID, Gender, Attendance (%), Marks in Math, Science, English, History, Computer
  - Calculated fields: Total, Average, Grade, Rank, Result (Pass/Fail)

---

📈 Key Insights
- 📉 *Attendance does not strongly correlate with marks* – High attendance doesn’t guarantee high performance.
- 📚 *English and History* have the most *low performers* (low medians and many outliers).
- 🔗 Strong subject correlation in:
  - Math & Science: 0.89  
  - English & History: 0.86  
  - Math & Computer: 0.85  
- 🏆 Students ranked based on total marks; *Pass* if average ≥ 35.

---

🔧 Tools Used
- *Python*: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- *Jupyter Notebook*
- *Excel*: For final reporting
- *PDF/Word*: For report sharing

---

📌 Recommendations
- Focus on *English and History* improvement via extra support.
- Engage high-attendance, low-performing students with *interactive teaching*.
- Leverage *subject group strategies* (e.g., Math-Science-Computer).
